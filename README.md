Update your daily to-do Trello board with dates. Provides a nice result like this:
![A photo showing what a board managed with the program looks like. On the leftmost column, the data 2025-06-11 is presented with carryover cards from the previous two dates.

You'll need to manually create yesterday's date if it doesn't exist already. You can automate this tool using `cron` or similar.
